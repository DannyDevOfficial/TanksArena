# Tanks Arena

An open-world tank game where you have to wreck other tanks and become the king of the arena!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Just a computer capable of running the Unreal Engine 4.18 or greater and possibly Visual Studio if you're a coder (p.s. Visual Studio is going to run even on the crappiest machine).
For testing purposes, on the other hand I will provide you with an installer where you'll be able to test the game.

### Installing

For development purposes, you will need to download and install a copy of the Unreal Engine 4.18 or greater, alongside a version of Visual Studio, if you are a coder.

```
1. Download and install the Unreal Engine (4.18 or greater) - click [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) to get it.
2. (Optional if you're a coder) Download and install Visual Studio - click [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/) to get it.
3. Now you're ready to contribute to this project's development, yay!
```

## Running the tests

Basically, Unreal Engine will take care of that for you and besides I haven't thought of writing any automated test for this project so far.
If I do end up writing tests, this document will get an update.

## Deployment

An installer should be made in order for people to play this game or even test it for that matter.
However it can be deployed as is, if it's for development purposes.

## Built With

* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) - The Graphics Engine used

## Contributing

I didn't create any separate file for this, even though it might be added in the future.

Nobody contributed yet! :(

## Versioning

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for versioning.
I also use [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to get a GUI so that I can simplify my work a ton.
